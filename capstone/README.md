# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

# Why is this important 

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. Given everyone has a smart phone anyone can easily share disaster in real-time. Monitoring such tweets would give agencies a quicker way to respond to emergency situation. 

# Data Sources

the challenge is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. A dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified is available.

Primary datasets:
- Tweet data collected for a customer with keywords 

# Techniques
## Part 1
- Do a text processing on the Tweets 
- Generate keyword fill for the Tweets 
- Generate Embed using BERT(https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert)
## Next steps 
- Use KNN clustering algorith to do a vector search for interesting terms (or use MongoDB vector search)

# Expected Results
- A good analysis of the sentiment would help in providing the right help by the first responder. 

# Why Is This Question Important
- Natural language processing is a great way to analyse sentiments and trends for any given field.
