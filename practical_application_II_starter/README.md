# Observations and Conclusions

## Observations

Being a used car dealer, it is important to understand what consumers value in a used car. Based on the data you provided us we were able to group and analyse the data to provide with valuable insights to improve the customer conversion rate. From the analysis it was clear some of the factors that predicts customers interest in buying a car are,

Car make year
Car Size
Car condition 

## Conclusions
- A more recently made used car in good condition sells better then an older badly maintained car.

## Futher invetigation Required
Though this is great start to understand customer behavior, but it did not uncover any major epiphany through data. 

## Not enough Data
- Purchase price and selling price for a car
- Manufacturing year and the year the car was sold
- Missing or incorrect values, example
- Rows with both odometer and price value set to 0
- Odometer value set to 0, does this mean its a new car?
- Missing data for model, manufacturer etc., Do you have a VIN database using which we can fill this data?
- What causes the large Outliers in the data
