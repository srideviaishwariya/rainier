# Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?

# Problem Statement 

European banks need to strengthen their financial assets. One approach is to offer long-term deposits with low interest rates through direct marketing campaigns. At the same time, they also need to reduce their costs and turnaround time. The problem is, the public has experienced some fatigue from all these campaigns, and they are not as effective as they could be. Can we learn from the data to find out what customer attributes increase the chance of a successful depost? If so, the campaigns can be tailored to these high-probability prospects, avoiding wasted time and resources on those that are less likely to deposit.

### Overview

The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who made a deposit vs who did not. 

### Data

The dataset you will use comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository Links to an external site.. The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. You can make use of the article Links to an external site.accompanying the dataset (in the .zip file) for more information on the data and features.

# Observations and Conclusions

## Observations
- The overall Acceptance rate for a deposit is ~89% when evaluating based on the feature set that includes age, job, education, marital status, loan, default and housing. 


## Futher invetigation Required
- Adding the social and economic context attributes to the Features would help determine if an up or down in the marker affects the customer behavior
